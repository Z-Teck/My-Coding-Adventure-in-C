# My Coding Adventure in C
All the files and projects I created and made while learning C. 
To execute them I would recomend using Macos as it has a built in C editor, compiler, and runner, all necceary to use these files.
I created and edited some of these at the terminal (the command line of mac for you windows users), and some using VS Code.
